## Summer 2020 Report

Clark Fitzgerald

_This report fulfills the remainder of my faculty startup request agreement with Dean Joanna Mott from March 2019, which required me to submit a proposal and report of outcomes for 1 month summer salary.
I submitted this report to Dr. David Zeigler, Chair, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, on DATE_


This summer I developed expertise in the new [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
Julia builds on existing compiler technology to solve many of the challenges in statistical computing through its fundamental design, which makes it a compelling choice for researchers experimenting with data science software and numerical algorithms.
In other areas, I collaborated with other faculty across campus on a statistical analysis, resulting in a publication.
I also advised an undergraduate student on a successful machine learning project.


## Paper Accepted in Behavioral Neuroscience

I analyzed the data for a project led by Jeff Calton in the Psychology Department.
The journal Behavioral Neuroscience accepted our paper titled "Disruption of the Anterior Thalamic Head Direction Signal Following Reduction of the Hippocampal Theta Rhythm" on August 10th.
By analyzing the time series of neuron firing data, I was able to provide evidence that no rhythmic patterns could be detected in the data, which was essential for the arguments and interpretation presented in the paper.


## Julia Reading Group

I organized and facilitated a reading group for the Julia programming language, which marks the beginning of a broader base of users on campus for this promising computer language.
A group of 5 to 10 students, faculty, and outside professionals met weekly for six weeks, from June 19th through July 24th to share and discuss solutions to the mathematical / algorithmic problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
We went from absolute beginners in the Julia language to being able to solve challenging mathematical problems.
This intimate, collegial discussion group worked well online; everybody both contributed and learned something.
Sacramento State now has a small core of Julia users to provide support for our subsequent individual programming efforts.


## Student Proposed Machine Learning Project

Stephen Gibson, a CSUS undergraduate student produced [SkateboardML](https://github.com/LightningDrop/SkateboardML), a machine learning project he proposed to distinguish videos of different skateboarding tricks.
First, he adapted an existing a computer vision model to this new use case of skateboarding.
The model worked well, producing accuracy near 90%.
Second, he produced a labeled data set with over 200 short video clips of skateboarding tricks.
This labeled video data can be even more useful than the model, because other researchers can use it to develop and validate new models.


## Other Outcomes

Besides the above projects, I worked on a number of smaller projects.
I continued my career as an open source developer by contributing to the [improved documentation of the Julia language](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/36202).
I contributed to the technical documentation of the Debugger package by writing an [introduction aimed at beginners](http://webpages.csus.edu/fitzgerald/julia-debugger-tutorial/).
I initiated [design discussions](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/when-should-a-function-accept-a-symbol-as-an-argument/43510) related to the technical differences between symbols and strings in the Julia language.
I developed my [personal Sac State website](http://webpages.csus.edu/fitzgerald/) so that I can use it to make my fall courses more accessible.
