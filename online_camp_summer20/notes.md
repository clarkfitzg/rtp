Final Action Plan Deliverable Template


Module Notes

## 1

Wow, it's great to have the firsthand student experience in a Canvas course!
My first impression is that there's a ton of stuff to do- information everywhere, some of it conflicting.
Walls and walls of text- yuck.
For example, do I need to respond to 1 slide or 2 slides on the intro activity?
The instructions on the slides say 1, but the rubric says 2.
The instructors ask us to 'add them to the Canvas courses', but don't provide any instructions on how to do that.
I already know how, so I look for the instructor email, but it's not on their profile.
I can't respond to the announcement, so I can't ask for clarification there.
I found the answer in my Canvas inbox, buried way down in a mass email.

Lesson: Pick one way to communicate with students, and use that consistently.
Canvas announcements are probably best, because they show up right on top of the course page.
Also, allow student replies on the announcement to ask for clarification right there.

There are a bunch of assignments on my Canvas TODO.
If I were a student with 5 classes, I would probably be doing the ones that are due soonest.
One assignment per week in my courses might be bad, because then students will probably put it off.
I think it's much easier to learn math and programming if you do shorter assignments regularly, instead of long assignments infrequently.

DRY- Do not Repeat Yourself.
Why are there different instructions for the same assignment in multiple places?
Better to just put everything on a rubric, and grade strictly from the rubric. 
Then there are no surprises.

Regarding course structure and navigation, I think simpler is usually better, especially in our current situation.
The QM template has 12 pages in the Welcome module.
If a student takes 5 courses, and each instructor uses this template, then the student needs to navigate through 60 pages, most of which is boilerplate.
This seems excessive and possibly counterproductive if the purpose of the pages is to highlight elements specific to this course.

I'm tempted to just delete everything from the template.
It's difficult for me to find a particular piece of information when I don't know what page it's on, because I have to click through every page.
In contrast, if you put all the administrative information on one page, the syllabus, then students and I can use CTRL+F on our web browsers to find the particular word we're interested in.

Of course, I want the students to feel welcome and included, and to have a clear idea of what's happening.
Maybe there are better ways to do this than creating a bunch of HTML pages.
For example, embed the welcome video in an announcement.

How can students know if they're all caught up in my class?
I want that to be completely clear.


## 2

Got an email reminding me to turn in an assignment that I already turned in.
This makes me wonder: "did I actually turn in the assignment?"
This could cause students stress.
We can eliminate this by using the feature on Canvas: "message students who have not completed this assignment", and not mentioning deadlines in other places.
In other words- communicate consistently, and try to be DRY.

What do I _have_ to know, as in what will I be tested on?
What's just a supplemental resource?
What should I read before doing the homework?

In the first week's quiz I could ask students what concerns they have, and how we can work together to mitigate them.
This might not be so hot, because it's negative.

The references in this course are clumsy.
I have no idea what QM 2.4, 3.9 means.
Better to use the power of the web and hyperlink where appropriate.

Some students like community and working together, while others like to just do their own work and be done.
I should offer ways for both to be successful, and keep the invitations open.
Also I should be clear on which activities are mandatory and which are not.
I want a community, but it's hard to force it on people.

Some students might struggle to get to class consistently, for many reasons.
What should I do about that?

Course suggests avoiding long lectures- good thing I already do that with my YouTube lectures.

Excellent question in one of the videos- what do you want your students to remember / take away from your course in one year, five years?
Keep this in mind when you write your course outcomes.

Idea: Assign students to write blog posts describing techniques with computation in STAT 128.
Clearly identify the audience: i.e. someone with an undergrad CS degree, but no knowledge of R.
This helps prepare them to be content creators.
Another assignment- interpret a data analysis for a general technical audience, explaining the techniques used.

## 3

I like Fink's taxonomy.
What's really important with computing is learning how to learn, how to test your mental model of what is happening.
The nuts and bolts of a particular language's syntax can be dull and similar.
It's better to understand the design and unifying ideas behind it all, or how certain decisions were made, and what the tradeoffs were.

I missed the deadlines to do peer review because I didn't work on a Sunday, and didn't bother to look at what was due that weekend.

I think the biggest problem for me last quarter was a lack of alignment.
This came out in the feedback, when students rightly complained that the exams were more difficult- on par with the worksheets, and the lectures and homeworks didn't prepare them to succeed on them.

Watching these videos and navigating the content in the online school, I feel pretty beat after a couple hours.
Could be the time of day, plus 6+ hours of screen time already today.
I'll bet students feel like that all the time, especially for courses that they're not excited about.

Feedback in assessments is nice.
I should do more of that.

TODO: Use [Inter font](https://rsms.me/inter/) for my personal website.
Beautiful, accessible font, what's not to like?

TODO: Adopt consistent naming schemes and locations for files / materials.
Make sure students know where they can find them.

My general principles of simplicity in online courses:

- Flat is better than nested.
- Fewer clicks are better.
- Fewer formats / sites are better.
    Whenever possible, stick with HTML.

As a counter example of simplicity, to learn about making PDF's accessible in my current course I had to click on another link, which brought me to another online course, where I had to browse to find the content, which I eventually contained in a .docx file that I had to download.

Last semester, when I posted PDF's generated from LaTeX: \LaTeXL A T E X, the accessibility meter was always red, meaning these are the least accessible documents. ðŸ˜¢ 

The module on accessibility has some content on how to make PDF's more accessible.
However, there's nothing specific to LaTeX: \LaTeXL A T E X, which is a widely used tool in STEM.
How to make it more accessible?

Musing now.
ðŸ¤” HTML is generally easier on students, because they don't have to download and mess around with separate documents.
Annotating PDF's works well on my tablet.
Maybe I'll just write the source in markdown so that I can generate both HTML and PDF's from it.
I'll just accept whatever bad formatting the defaults produce in the PDF.
That seems like it would offer the most flexibility with the least amount of work.

It's not clear to me exactly how these Community of Inquiry ideas apply to math courses.
Do we talk about how people feel about theorems?

I wonder if I could occasionally have my kids appear, for example, when I send the students a quick video.
People do that with their pets, say it makes them seem more human to their students.

TODO: Personal feedback on assignments / exams.
Wow, even possible to do video and audio feedback on assignments and quizzes- that has some great potential.
If I could screen capture while I scroll through their work and point out what's strong and places to improve- that would be super cool, and probably faster / better than written comments.
Often I'm thinking, "ah, simple arithmetic mistake. Darn!"
I'll have to be judicious about where and how I use it though.
Only have so much time.
A weekly personal message _seems_ doable.
I'll have 100 students.
If each one takes 1-2 minutes to do that's 2-4 hours grading / messaging per week.

Maybe I could even encourage the students to make voice recordings of comments with their assignment submissions, opens it up for a two way asynchronous communication.
Voices and videos can express much more emotion than simple text.
It's also probably easier for them to say things in a voice recording they wouldn't say in written text- like if they're frustrated, what worked, what didn't.
I can emphasize that this is an entirely private communication between us, and I will never share specifics with anyone else.

Send welcome email, open Canvas up a week or two before the semester starts.

Need to know if students have trouble accessing any recorded material.

Tell students- I never used emoji before, but I think they can help make online courses feel more human.
So I do it, even though I think they're ridiculous.

Have SLA to set expectations for email responsiveness.

Wow, it's clear that having too many words per line is hard to read.

How do I implement proactive support?
Encouraging students to come to office hours doesn't seem to suffice.
What if I reserved slots during class time for office hours, and then assigned this to some students?
That could make them feel singled out.

I like the idea of soliciting student ideas for how to make equitable and inclusive courses.
For example, I'm a heterosexual white male, and I don't feel like I know what makes courses equitable and inclusive.

Just spoke with a student about diversity and inclusion, and he said how students often look up to their Professors.
Be caring, Don't be arrogant.
It seems like common sense, but don't shame them or make them feel dumb if they ask a question that is simple.
Especially don't do this publicly.
I asked him and he said I didn't do this sort of thing, but he's heard stories.
Indeed, I've been on the receiving end of such behavior.
First generation college students may be particularly sensitive, suffering from imposter syndrome.

He also mentioned how people don't expect statistics to be a politically and emotionally loaded class.
Perhaps I could use this to generate engagement and interest in the course.
Find things they care about, and show how to use statistics to create bias.

Wouldn't that be a super cool assignment- have students use the same data set and generate completely opposite interpretations.
Say that you can delete outliers, or reinterpret the meanings of the fields as you see fit.

This seems to also come up often when people start learning to program.
The computer does not "know what you meant".
It does exactly what you tell it, every time, and this makes it unforgiving.

I need an example of "hidden curriculum" embedded in schools before I know what it means.
I can't find anything actionable in this DEI material.
I want to know concisely and practically what I can do.
I don't understand the jargon around these academic disciplines outside my domain.

Funny- tiny image infographic- no possibility of reading.
Cool idea for a project: an infographic generator.

Idea: Use data gathered from class in surveys to choose the most interesting case studies for homework assignments.

Think-pair-share?

Watching this very elaborate reading activity for an English class.
Would it be possible to do a similar activity with reading a Statistics textbook?
Maybe!
I could identify important passages of text and have students read them while I share my screen and make highlights and annotations.
Have each student read one paragraph at a time.

Idea: get groups competing for extra credit.
Incentivizes interaction and participation.

Idea: model example discussion activity and allow time for questions __before__ sending people to breakout rooms.
Then they don't spend time messing around reading the directions asking, what does he want us to do?

Open educational resources- I'm all about it.

I feel like some of the structure in the class constrains me.
The purpose of all these classes is to think hard about how to best deliver online classes.
Activities are only valuable if they're a means to this end.


## 5

The formatting on the Canvas rubric is not good- too hard to read with the long vertical columns.
It would be better to keep the rubric as a separate document.

Summative assessments measure student performance.

Watching this video that's just text and a bunch of things moving around for no reason.
Why not just make text?

I don't feel like I can ditch the textbook yet.
It's a pretty good resource.

Here are some things I can potentially do for assessment in STAT 50:
- homework, Mcgraw Hill automated
- homework, Mcgraw Hill manual
- discussions, read a relevant news article and analyze the statistics used.
    They can submit responses in videos or text.
- quizzes, Mcgraw Hill
- quizzes, Canvas
- written quiz where I give personal feedback
- written hw where I give personal feedback

Literally every math or math related course I've ever taken in undergrad relied mostly on exams to determine the final grade.
There's nothing subjective.

Here's an idea- what if I just get rid of all the quizzes, exams, and finals, and just call them something different?
Although there is that department policy that every course have a final.

It's funny to see how this course breaks even the most basic rules of web content- write informative text for the hyperlink, not "here".

What is the effect of honor codes in quizzes?
Does it matter?

I feel like so much of this course doesn't apply to math- it seems more geared towards the humanities.
Hopefully the STEM course can fill in the gaps.

Hmmm... multiple opportunities to pass the same test.
Students liked that when I gave it to them.
I wonder if I could do that on the midterms?

Wow, there's a policy for how much study time courses should take!
"undergraduate courses should provide one hour of lecture along with two hours study time each week, per unit, for a total of 45 hours over a 15-week semester."
STAT 50 is 4 units, which means 4 hours in class and 8 hours outside of class.
I always thought it was 3 hours outside of class.
What does that mean for a math course though?
One person can easily take 10x longer than another to understand the same concept, and then still not get it as well.

For STAT 128, the outcome is that the students can apply stats to real data and produce reasonable solutions.
The HW's can all do that.
It would be good to add a reflection / meta part to each assignment.

The scoring guide rubric in Canvas is probably what I should use.


## 6

This module organization seems like a PITA for both the students and the instructor.
I don't need a video reading a script that's directly below it, because I can read and retain much faster than I watch a video.
Then again, students might not learn the same way I do, and they might appreciate the video.
Students who don't want to watch it can skip over it.

I think it makes more sense to stick tighter to the textbook content, and avoid creating my own content where possible, especially in STAT 50.
People have thought about what to do in intro stats classes for a long time, and I think they can do a fine job explaining the concepts.
It's sometimes hard for me, because I've seen the problems before, and they're really obvious to me.
I can supplement the text with other material that I feel is important.
In other words, staying within the boundaries prescribed by the book seems safe and sustainable to deliver a standard class.
STAT 50 is not the place to get all creative and develop content- that's what the computing classes are for.
Better to give them lots of standard practice problems, and work through them during lecture.

Idea: align everything up with the book sections and chapters- modules, homeworks, exams, everything.
This is more clear for the students.

Another thing- my performance is evaluated based on numerical scores in courses.
Why do anything that will lower my score, especially if it's more work for me?
That doesn't make any sense at all.

Explicitly describe social norms with salutations and signatures.

When I use Mcgraw Hill I need to have the student experience- make sure I go through and try to do the homework as they see it.

In Spring 2020 I used a LOT of announcements as things always changed.
COVID-19 forced that on everyone.
It would be better to structure the course in a way that I don't need to make any announcements.
All the activities are regular and predictable.

I like the submission comments as a way to communicate personally with the students.
This can take the place of a journal.

Is it possible to import questions from Mcgraw Hill into Canvas?
That would be kind of nice.

Embedded content from my personal website in Canvas basically doesn't work.
The URL is http, so the students need to permit Canvas to display insecure content.
When they do that, all the CSS and other goodies go away, so it looks like crap.
Disappointing.

I'm not satisfied with the [current STAT 50 syllabus](https://www.csus.edu/college/natural-sciences-mathematics/mathematics-statistics/_internal/docs/stat050.pdf)
This is a terminal statistics course, so students should come out of the course with the ability to apply stats to problems in their domain.

I scored 4.5 out of 12 on the rubric assignment.
This appears to be mostly pedantic, because I didn't use the Canvas rubric.
This makes me think I need to focus more on fulfilling the pedantic rubric requirements, and less on thinking hard about what will really make a positive student experience.
In other words, I'm not invested in the class anymore.
Good thing it's almost done.

I have several reasons for not using the Canvas rubric:

1. I tried and tried to get the rubric to work last semester, and it never worked for statistics, because I cannot specify the exact feedback that relates to the student work.
    Thus, the rubric does not help in providing feedback.
    Instead, I plan to leave personal, individual feedback using a variety of media.
2. When I look at the rubric and I see a bunch of negative or half done things, it makes me think about the bare minimum I can do to eke by.
    I want to tell students what excellence looks like, not mediocrity.
3. For actual descriptive rubrics, as in this course, the rubric formatting is nearly unintelligible with the text in very long columns, and it will be even worse on mobile.
    It drives me crazy to read or write them.
    Legible text on a web page is far better.


I've been looking more into Canvas Outcomes- there's so much potential here, but so little functionality.
Guess I'll just have to maintain something separate myself.
ðŸ˜¢ That's the story of my experience with Canvas.
Probably I'm focusing excessively on the negatives.
Canvas could certainly be a lot worse.

TODO: Include code of conduct.

What's a good pace for quizzes, homeworks, and exams?
I'm thinking to do two light homeworks per week for STAT 50.
How about quizzes every week, half online, and half written / take home.
I want to give them real feedback on handwritten work.
Actually it depends on if we get Gradescope how feasible this will be.

I definitely want to have fewer high stakes exams, to disincentivize cheating.

Written feedback can indeed come across differently and more harshly than intended.
How many times did I feel that during my PhD?
How can I soften the blow, and focus on the positive and growth?

Idea: incorporate some competitive games each week.
For example, we'll read the top three discussion responses.

TODO: Make submission comments a part of weekly assignment submissions.
Get students to speak to me, and tell me what's going on in the assignments where I'm providing them spoken or video feedback.

Idea: assign students to create content (videos, slides, podcasts) explaining some concept in statistics.
Give them an audience- you're talking to a small child, a businessman, a judge.

Use more real examples.
Look hard and find real models and applications.

Idea: Give students time during class to research a topic and then discuss.
