Final Action Plan Deliverable Template


Module Notes

## 1

Wow, it's great to have the firsthand student experience in a Canvas course!
My first impression is that there's a ton of stuff to do- information everywhere, some of it conflicting.
Walls and walls of text- yuck.
For example, do I need to respond to 1 slide or 2 slides on the intro activity?
The instructions on the slides say 1, but the rubric says 2.
The instructors ask us to 'add them to the Canvas courses', but don't provide any instructions on how to do that.
I already know how, so I look for the instructor email, but it's not on their profile.
I can't respond to the announcement, so I can't ask for clarification there.
I found the answer in my Canvas inbox, buried way down in a mass email.

Lesson: Pick one way to communicate with students, and use that consistently.
Canvas announcements are probably best, because they show up right on top of the course page.
Also, allow student replies on the announcement to ask for clarification right there.

There are a bunch of assignments on my Canvas TODO.
If I were a student with 5 classes, I would probably be doing the ones that are due soonest.
One assignment per week in my courses might be bad, because then students will probably put it off.
I think it's much easier to learn math and programming if you do shorter assignments regularly, instead of long assignments infrequently.

DRY- Do not Repeat Yourself.
Why are there different instructions for the same assignment in multiple places?
Better to just put everything on a rubric, and grade strictly from the rubric. 
Then there are no surprises.

Regarding course structure and navigation, I think simpler is usually better, especially in our current situation.
The QM template has 12 pages in the Welcome module.
If a student takes 5 courses, and each instructor uses this template, then the student needs to navigate through 60 pages, most of which is boilerplate.
This seems excessive and possibly counterproductive if the purpose of the pages is to highlight elements specific to this course.

I'm tempted to just delete everything from the template.
It's difficult for me to find a particular piece of information when I don't know what page it's on, because I have to click through every page.
In contrast, if you put all the administrative information on one page, the syllabus, then students and I can use CTRL+F on our web browsers to find the particular word we're interested in.

Of course, I want the students to feel welcome and included, and to have a clear idea of what's happening.
Maybe there are better ways to do this than creating a bunch of HTML pages.
For example, embed the welcome video in an announcement.

How can students know if they're all caught up in my class?
I want that to be completely clear.


## 2

Got an email reminding me to turn in an assignment that I already turned in.
This makes me wonder: "did I actually turn in the assignment?"
This could cause students stress.
We can eliminate this by using the feature on Canvas: "message students who have not completed this assignment", and not mentioning deadlines in other places.
In other words- communicate consistently, and try to be DRY.

What do I _have_ to know, as in what will I be tested on?
What's just a supplemental resource?
What should I read before doing the homework?

In the first week's quiz I could ask students what concerns they have, and how we can work together to mitigate them.
This might not be so hot, because it's negative.

The references in this course are clumsy.
I have no idea what QM 2.4, 3.9 means.
Better to use the power of the web and hyperlink where appropriate.

Some students like community and working together, while others like to just do their own work and be done.
I should offer ways for both to be successful, and keep the invitations open.
Also I should be clear on which activities are mandatory and which are not.
I want a community, but it's hard to force it on people.

Some students might struggle to get to class consistently, for many reasons.
What should I do about that?

Course suggests avoiding long lectures- good thing I already do that with my YouTube lectures.

Excellent question in one of the videos- what do you want your students to remember / take away from your course in one year, five years?
Keep this in mind when you write your course outcomes.

Idea: Assign students to write blog posts describing techniques with computation in STAT 128.
Clearly identify the audience: i.e. someone with an undergrad CS degree, but no knowledge of R.
This helps prepare them to be content creators.
Another assignment- interpret a data analysis for a general technical audience, explaining the techniques used.

## 3

I like Fink's taxonomy.
What's really important with computing is learning how to learn, how to test your mental model of what is happening.
The nuts and bolts of a particular language's syntax can be dull and similar.
It's better to understand the design and unifying ideas behind it all, or how certain decisions were made, and what the tradeoffs were.

I missed the deadlines to do peer review because I didn't work on a Sunday, and didn't bother to look at what was due that weekend.

I think the biggest problem for me last quarter was a lack of alignment.
This came out in the feedback, when students rightly complained that the exams were more difficult- on par with the worksheets, and the lectures and homeworks didn't prepare them to succeed on them.

Watching these videos and navigating the content in the online school, I feel pretty beat after a couple hours.
Could be the time of day, plus 6+ hours of screen time already today.
I'll bet students feel like that all the time, especially for courses that they're not excited about.

Feedback in assessments is nice.
I should do more of that.

TODO: Use [Inter font](https://rsms.me/inter/) for my personal website.
Beautiful, accessible font, what's not to like?

TODO: Adopt consistent naming schemes and locations for files / materials.
Make sure students know where they can find them.

My general principles of simplicity in online courses:

- Flat is better than nested.
- Fewer clicks are better.
- Fewer formats / sites are better.
    Whenever possible, stick with HTML.

As a counter example of simplicity, to learn about making PDF's accessible in my current course I had to click on another link, which brought me to another online course, where I had to browse to find the content, which I eventually contained in a .docx file that I had to download.

Last semester, when I posted PDF's generated from LaTeX: \LaTeXL A T E X, the accessibility meter was always red, meaning these are the least accessible documents. ðŸ˜¢ 

The module on accessibility has some content on how to make PDF's more accessible.
However, there's nothing specific to LaTeX: \LaTeXL A T E X, which is a widely used tool in STEM.
How to make it more accessible?

Musing now.
ðŸ¤” HTML is generally easier on students, because they don't have to download and mess around with separate documents.
Annotating PDF's works well on my tablet.
Maybe I'll just write the source in markdown so that I can generate both HTML and PDF's from it.
I'll just accept whatever bad formatting the defaults produce in the PDF.
That seems like it would offer the most flexibility with the least amount of work.

It's not clear to me exactly how these Community of Inquiry ideas apply to math courses.
Do we talk about how people feel about theorems?

I wonder if I could occasionally have my kids appear, for example, when I send the students a quick video.
People do that with their pets, say it makes them seem more human to their students.

TODO: Personal feedback on assignments / exams.
Wow, even possible to do video and audio feedback on assignments and quizzes- that has some great potential.
If I could screen capture while I scroll through their work and point out what's strong and places to improve- that would be super cool, and probably faster / better than written comments.
Often I'm thinking, "ah, simple arithmetic mistake. Darn!"
I'll have to be judicious about where and how I use it though.
Only have so much time.
A weekly personal message _seems_ doable.
I'll have 100 students.
If each one takes 1-2 minutes to do that's 2-4 hours grading / messaging per week.

Maybe I could even encourage the students to make voice recordings of comments with their assignment submissions, opens it up for a two way asynchronous communication.
Voices and videos can express much more emotion than simple text.
It's also probably easier for them to say things in a voice recording they wouldn't say in written text- like if they're frustrated, what worked, what didn't.
I can emphasize that this is an entirely private communication between us, and I will never share specifics with anyone else.

Send welcome email, open Canvas up a week or two before the semester starts.

Need to know if students have trouble accessing any recorded material.

Tell students- I never used emoji before, but I think they can help make online courses feel more human.
So I do it, even though I think they're ridiculous.

Have SLA to set expectations for email responsiveness.

Wow, it's clear that having too many words per line is hard to read.

How do I implement proactive support?
Encouraging students to come to office hours doesn't seem to suffice.
What if I reserved slots during class time for office hours, and then assigned this to some students?
That could make them feel singled out.

I like the idea of soliciting student ideas for how to make equitable and inclusive courses.
For example, I'm a heterosexual white male, and I don't feel like I know what makes courses equitable and inclusive.

Just spoke with a student about diversity and inclusion, and he said how students often look up to their Professors.
Be caring, Don't be arrogant.
It seems like common sense, but don't shame them or make them feel dumb if they ask a question that is simple.
Especially don't do this publicly.
I asked him and he said I didn't do this sort of thing, but he's heard stories.
Indeed, I've been on the receiving end of such behavior.
First generation college students may be particularly sensitive, suffering from imposter syndrome.

He also mentioned how people don't expect statistics to be a politically and emotionally loaded class.
Perhaps I could use this to generate engagement and interest in the course.
Find things they care about, and show how to use statistics to create bias.

Wouldn't that be a super cool assignment- have students use the same data set and generate completely opposite interpretations.
Say that you can delete outliers, or reinterpret the meanings of the fields as you see fit.

This seems to also come up often when people start learning to program.
The computer does not "know what you meant".
It does exactly what you tell it, every time, and this makes it unforgiving.

I need an example of "hidden curriculum" embedded in schools before I know what it means.
I can't find anything actionable in this DEI material.
I want to know concisely and practically what I can do.
I don't understand the jargon around these academic disciplines outside my domain.

Funny- tiny image infographic- no possibility of reading.
Cool idea for a project: an infographic generator.

Idea: Use data gathered from class in surveys to choose the most interesting case studies for homework assignments.

Think-pair-share?

Watching this very elaborate reading activity for an English class.
Would it be possible to do a similar activity with reading a Statistics textbook?
Maybe!
I could identify important passages of text and have students read them while I share my screen and make highlights and annotations.
Have each student read one paragraph at a time.

Idea: get groups competing for extra credit.
Incentivizes interaction and participation.

Idea: model example discussion activity and allow time for questions __before__ sending people to breakout rooms.
Then they don't spend time messing around reading the directions asking, what does he want us to do?

Open educational resources- I'm all about it.

I feel like some of the structure in the class constrains me.
The purpose of all these classes is to think hard about how to best deliver online classes.
Activities are only valuable if they're a means to this end.
