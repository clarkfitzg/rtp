## Action Plan

Clark Fitzgerald


### What do I plan to do for my fall semester course(s)?

Pick one way to communicate with students, and use that consistently.
Canvas announcements are probably best, because they show up right on top of the course page.
Also, allow student replies on the announcement to ask for clarification right there.

I think it's much easier to learn math and programming if you do shorter assignments regularly, instead of long assignments infrequently.

Regarding course structure and navigation, I think simpler is usually better, especially in our current situation.
I'm going to design my online experience to be simple.
My general principles of simplicity in online courses:

- Flat is better than nested.
- Fewer clicks are better.
- Fewer formats / sites are better.
    Whenever possible, stick with HTML.

List outcomes for course and module, make it very obvious what students will be tested on.
Align every activitiy and assessment of the course with the outcomes using backwards design.

Adopt consistent naming schemes and locations for files / materials.
Make sure students know where they can find them.

Personal feedback on assignments / exams.
Wow, even possible to do video and audio feedback on assignments and quizzes- that has some great potential.
If I could screen capture while I scroll through their work and point out what's strong and places to improve- that would be super cool, and probably faster / better than written comments.
Often I'm thinking, "ah, simple arithmetic mistake. Darn!"
I'll have to be judicious about where and how I use it though.
Only have so much time.
A weekly personal message _seems_ doable.
I'll have 100 students.
If each one takes 1-2 minutes to do that's 2-4 hours grading / messaging per week.
That's very optimistic.
I could even encourage the students to make voice recordings of comments with their assignment submissions, opens it up for a two way asynchronous communication.
Voices and videos can express much more emotion than simple text.
It's also probably easier for them to say things in a voice recording they wouldn't say in written text- like if they're frustrated, what worked, what didn't.
I can emphasize that this is an entirely private communication between us, and I will never share specifics with anyone else.

Send welcome email, open Canvas up a week or two before the semester starts.

Find out if students have trouble accessing any recorded material.

Tell students- I never used emoji before, but I think they can help make online courses feel more human.
So I do it, even though I think they're ridiculous.

Have SLA to set expectations for email responsiveness.

Model example discussion activity and allow time for questions __before__ sending people to breakout rooms.
Then they don't spend time messing around reading the directions asking, what does he want us to do?

Stick tighter to the textbook content, and avoid creating my own content where possible, especially in STAT 50.
People have thought about what to do in intro stats classes for a long time, and I think they can do a fine job explaining the concepts.
It's sometimes hard for me, because I've seen the problems before, and they're really obvious to me.
I can supplement the text with other material that I feel is important.
In other words, staying within the boundaries prescribed by the book seems safe and sustainable to deliver a standard class.
STAT 50 is not the place to get all creative and develop content- that's what the computing classes are for.
Better to give them lots of standard practice problems, and work through them during lecture.

Explicitly describe social norms with salutations and signatures.

Include code of conduct.

When I use Mcgraw Hill I need to have the student experience- make sure I go through and try to do the homework as they see it.

I definitely want to have fewer high stakes exams, to disincentivize cheating.

TODO: Make submission comments a part of weekly assignment submissions.
Get students to speak to me, and tell me what's going on in the assignments where I'm providing them spoken or video feedback.



### What might I do for my fall semester course(s)?

In the first week's quiz I could ask students what concerns they have, and how we can work together to mitigate them.
This might not be a good idea, because it's rather negative.

Hyperlink to course outcomes.
I still need to figure out how to do this.

Assign students to write blog posts describing techniques with computation in STAT 128.
Clearly identify the audience: i.e. someone with an undergrad CS degree, but no knowledge of R.
This helps prepare them to be content creators.
Another assignment- interpret a data analysis for a general technical audience, explaining the techniques used.

Use data gathered from class in surveys to choose the most interesting case studies for homework assignments.

Watching this very elaborate reading activity for an English class.
Would it be possible to do a similar activity with reading a Statistics textbook?
Maybe!
I could identify important passages of text and have students read them while I share my screen and make highlights and annotations.
Have each student read one paragraph at a time.

Idea: get groups competing for extra credit.
Incentivizes interaction and participation.

Here are some things I can potentially do for assessment in STAT 50:
- homework, Mcgraw Hill automated
- homework, Mcgraw Hill manual
- discussions, read a relevant news article and analyze the statistics used.
    They can submit responses in videos or text.
- quizzes, Mcgraw Hill
- quizzes, Canvas
- written quiz where I give personal feedback
- written hw where I give personal feedback

Give students multiple opportunities to pass the same test.
Students liked that when I gave it to them.
I wonder if I could do that on the midterms?

Assign students to create content (videos, slides, podcasts) explaining some concept in statistics.
Give them an audience- you're talking to a small child, a businessman, a judge.

Use more real examples.
Look hard and find real models and applications.

Give students time during class to research a topic and then discuss.


### What do I want to save for later for another semester?

I wonder if I could occasionally have my kids appear, for example, when I send the students a quick video.
People do that with their pets, say it makes them seem more human to their students.

Embedded content from my personal website in Canvas basically doesn't work.
The URL is http, so the students need to permit Canvas to display insecure content.
When they do that, all the CSS and other goodies go away, so it looks like crap.
Disappointing.

I'm not using the Canvas rubric for several reasons:
1. I tried and tried to get the rubric to work last semester, and it never worked for statistics, because I cannot specify the exact feedback that relates to the student work.
    Thus, the rubric does not help in providing feedback.
    Instead, I plan to leave personal, individual feedback using a variety of media.
3. When I look at the rubric and I see a bunch of negative or half done things, it makes me think about the bare minimum I can do to eke by.
    I want to tell students what excellence looks like, not mediocrity.
2. For actual descriptive rubrics, as in this course, the rubric formatting is nearly unintelligible with the text in very long columns, and it will be even worse on mobile.
    It drives me crazy to read or write them.
    Legible text on a web page is far better.
