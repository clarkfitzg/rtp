Clark Fitzgerald


## Course Outcomes: 

(from sample department syllabus)

CO1 Understand the basic principles of probability including the laws for unions, intersections, and complementation, Bayes theorem and use these principles in problem solving situations. 

CO2 Understand the definitions of discrete, continuous, and joint random variables, compute the mean, variance and covariance of random variables, know the definition of density and distribution function of a random variable and be able to find one from the other, and be able to find the marginal density and distribution functions from the joint density function.
