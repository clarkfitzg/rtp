__Dates:__ day 1

__Topic:__ Introduction

__Objectives:__

- ~~students have positive impression of course~~
    _Real goal is to establish and build community, but I don't know how to measure this._
- students can navigate course
- students have clear understanding of course structure, when assignments are due, etc.
- students know how instructor will communicate with them
- students know how to reach instructor and get questions answered
- students set up appropriate Canvas notifications
- students set their profile picture on Zoom and Canvas
- students are motivated to turn on audio and video
- students understand when we will hold syncronous classes

__Activities:__

- Icebreaker? Perhaps introduce 1-2-3-go activity to test student's intuition about some unintuitive statistical concepts and get them excited about the course.
- Motivation? Speech on how statistics is an essential component of data science?
- Live instructor demo of site navigation and Canvas notifications.

__Materials:__ 

- Canvas login
- Canvas syllabus and welcome pages
- ability to record and upload video


__Assessments/Deliverables:__

- navigation quiz. 
    This is only nominally a quiz, because it won't have a time limit, and everyone who submits something should get a full score.
- upload introductory video

__Objectives:__

- (CO1) construct boxplots, histograms, and scatterplots from data
- (CO1) interpret boxplots, histograms, and scatterplots by inferring statistics such as range, percentiles, and correlation
