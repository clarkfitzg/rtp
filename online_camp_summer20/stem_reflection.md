I try hard to make the lectures in STAT 50 as interactive and engaging as possible.
One way I do this is "warm call" activities, meaning that I notify a student that they will be called on in the next couple minutes.
When an appropriate place comes in the lecture, I ask them to do some minimal task, such as read a text definition from the screen, or verify some arithmetic that I've done.
If the student cannot easily answer, then I rephrase or simplify the question, and generally guide them gently towards the correct response.
Students usually speak for less than 10 seconds, and I can get through 5 - 15 students in a typical 50 minute lecture.

The logistics of the course should be as simple as possible.
I alternate my warm call activities with "123 GO" activities.
I ask conceptual questions with simple answers, everyone types their answer in the Zoom chat, and then I count down with "123 GO", and everyone presses enter simultaneously so that we can all see what people respond with.
This activity is simple and effective, as it allows me to keep a pulse on the class and immediately guide them to the correct mental model.

Students are allowed to opt out of interactive classroom participation at any time, with no penalty.
I recognize that students may have poor internet connections, may be in distracting environments, or may be uncomfortable unmuting themselves in front of 30 other students.
