Avoid dependent problems, because it's hard if students make a mistake early on, and you need to track it through the problem.

Just watched a webinar on mid course evaluations.
Seems like a good idea, especially early in the course.
It asks whether the teacher mostly lectures, or uses in class activities.

It mentioned observable outcomes, such as:

- Is the course well organized?
- Are the assignments clear?
- Has the instructor made an effort to learn my name?
- Do I get timely feedback?

Then it left free form text.
Let it be anonymous.

I plan to administer it in the hope that I can use the info to improve the course this semester.

I should do more coding and simulation in class.
I'll bet they would like that.
