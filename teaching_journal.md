Most students in Stat 50 don't start HW until day it's due.
I know because of online HW.
For lower div courses I prefer to give more short assignments, i.e. 2 or 3 per week rather than 1 per week.
It's also not worth much of their grade, only 10%.

I've been having quizzes and exams on Friday- I wonder how much the day of the week matters?
I do like to get them back graded the next class meeting, and that's easier if I have more than 1 day.

Wondering how much to focus on calculation versus conceptual questions.
I think it's good to have a mix of both.

Avoid dependent problems, because it's hard if students make a mistake early on, and you need to track it through the problem.

In the word problems I'm starting to use names that are representative of the student body population, rather than "Joe".

Just watched a webinar on mid course evaluations.
Seems like a good idea, especially early in the course.
It asks whether the teacher mostly lectures, or uses in class activities.

It mentioned observable outcomes, such as:

- Is the course well organized?
- Are the assignments clear?
- Has the instructor made an effort to learn my name?
- Do I get timely feedback?

Then it left free form text.
Let it be anonymous.

I plan to administer it in the hope that I can use the info to improve the course this semester.

I should do more coding and simulation in class.
I'll bet they would like that.
