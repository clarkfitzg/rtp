Saw positive responses for Kahoot extra credit quiz, for example:

> While other gave us online zoom recordings and quizzes @professor fitz gave us extra credit :pray:
> Thank you professor

I think the quick feedback helped with this- I put the extra credit in immediately after the quiz.
It's one less TODO item for later.

This makes me think about the human psychology around the language "extra credit".
It's similar to buying something that is $500 on sale for $400 with "free shipping".
Compared to paying the standard fixed price of $350 with $20 shipping.

With extra credit, students feel good, like they're doing something above and beyond.

Did a lecture in STAT 50 where we discussed real life scenarios and which data generated processes should be IID.
It felt right- less formal mathematics, more reasoning about what the underlying concepts and assumptions are.

For online courses

TODO: incorporate video assignments into courses.

Thu Jul 23 13:58:28 PDT 2020

Reading [NYT article on effort and achievement](https://nymag.com/news/features/27840/).
I wonder how I can incorporate more safe failure into my classes?

stat128: activity on "cleaning up code".
    Take code that repeats itself many times, and put it in an `lapply`.
    Write process for this: identify repetition, put it in function, call appropriate apply function.

Idea: Optional class meetings?
Need some way to filter the breakout rooms so that only people who actually want to talk are there.

Teaching philosophy: Students get out of school what they put into it.

Applying to summer online teaching


__Specifically, what is the single most important thing you hope to gain/learn from the STEM Side Car experience that will directly impact your teaching in the Fall?__

I hope to learn techniques to engage students and cultivate a sense of community in the online classroom. 
I believe that for online classes, this sense of community can only come from intentional structure and design of activities; it won't happen spontaneously as it sometimes does in a physical classroom.
Once classes went online in Spring 2020, I found it difficult to encourage students to speak up and ask questions.
Sometimes worksheet breakout sessions with small groups sparked vibrant conversation, and other times they were completely silent.
How can I design my online classes so students can benefit from our department's relatively small class sizes?
How can I help students invest in the online class community, and feel they belong?


__How are you hoping this experience will affect your future teaching?__

First of all, I need basic education in how to teach effectively.
Spring 2020 was my first semester teaching, and my PhD at an R1 University didn't emphasize teaching too much.

Second, I hope that I can incorporate some of the positive aspects of online classes into my future in person classes.
For example, some simple grading tasks can be automated, which provides students with immediate feedback compared to returning paper copies.

What I want in hand written assignment grading:

- detailed feedback
- anonymous, as in- I don't want to know who I'm grading, because otherwise whatever opinion I've formed on that student could creep in.
- PDF with camscanner, or other app
- rectangle around final answer


Thu May 14 17:03:05 PDT 2020

Grading finals now, fighting with Canvas rubrics because I'm trying to use them like I used Gradescope, and they're not working.
The lowest score on the final was from a student who turned all the HW in super early, before I even posted lectures.
How were they doing the hw?
It makes me think the HW score should be worth relatively less.

Next time I'm going to make everyone use cam scanner, or something that compiles a PDF.
So much easier for grading.


Fri May  1 08:24:10 PDT 2020

There are so many little things to consider when teaching online.
For example, I use a small 13" monitor so that when I share my screen students who also may be on small monitors can see what I'm doing.


Wed Apr 29 09:58:37 PDT 2020

It seems like males participate more in the online group discussion activities.
Is this a real effect?
No, I think it's just one class has few females, most of whom are quiet.


Wed Apr 15 15:45:29 PDT 2020

I like using names in my word problems.
It makes things feel more engaging, more active.
Further, I can sample names from a diverse mix of students to quietly slip in the idea that all races and genders can do stats / math / computing.

Compare:
"A 95% confidence interval was found."

"Chloe found a 95% confidence interval."

Students are complaining (fairly) that it's not clear what they need to study to do well on the exams.
I'm thinking that for a lower division course I need to be very explicit about what's required to pass.
I think the 25-30% fail rate is not good.
Probably this should mean they can do basic problems like the ones on the homework.
To get an A is another matter- for this they should be able to do harder problems.


Fri Mar 27 10:34:37 PDT 2020

Aligning course outcomes is a powerful feature in Canvas.
I'm using these.
Students ask for study guides- standards and evaluation should be clear and focused, especially in lower division classes where students follow a relativey structured material.

It might be educational to plant incorrect solutions to quizzes in Canvas.
Then students should carefully review their solutions to quizzes to make sure they understand them.


Mon Mar  9 07:57:35 PDT 2020

Most students in Stat 50 don't start HW until day it's due.
I know because of online HW.
For lower div courses I prefer to give more short assignments, i.e. 2 or 3 per week rather than 1 per week.
It's also not worth much of their grade, only 10%.


Fri Mar  6 06:51:06 PST 2020

I've been having quizzes and exams on Friday- I wonder how much the day of the week matters?
I do like to get them back graded the next class meeting, and that's easier if I have more than 1 day.

Wondering how much to focus on calculation versus conceptual questions.
I think it's good to have a mix of both.


Mon Feb 24 13:38:53 PST 2020

Avoid dependent problems, because it's hard if students make a mistake early on, and you need to track it through the problem.


Sat Feb 22 06:58:13 PST 2020

In the word problems I'm starting to use names that are representative of the student body population, rather than "Joe".


Wed Feb 19 15:02:24 PST 2020

Just watched a webinar on mid course evaluations.
Seems like a good idea, especially early in the course.
It asks whether the teacher mostly lectures, or uses in class activities.

It mentioned observable outcomes, such as:

- Is the course well organized?
- Are the assignments clear?
- Has the instructor made an effort to learn my name?
- Do I get timely feedback?

Then it left free form text.
Let it be anonymous.

I plan to administer it in the hope that I can use the info to improve the course this semester.

I should do more coding and simulation in class.
I'll bet they would like that.
