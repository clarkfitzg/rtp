Possible Zoom recordings for evaluation:

- 12 March, STAT 50 - lots of Zoom annotations
- 3 March, STAT 196K - more energy, bouncing back from surgery


Fri Mar  5 09:31:10 PST 2021

I see these benefits of the iPad over the chalkboard:
I distribute these notes via Canvas after class, so everyone has access. This means students can focus more on engaging and paying attention, rather than trying to write everything down.
We spend less time writing definitions, and more time explaining underlying concepts.
It forces me to design and prepare my lectures with more structure and purpose than they would have otherwise.
There are many little features that improve the rhythm and experience of the presentation, like zooming to show detail, erasing, copying and pasting, switching colors, and highlighting.

Discord- students using #off-topic to find roommate with same major.


Fri Feb 12 15:24:08 PST 2021

Wishing I did more with relational data in STAT 128.

Discord is going well- got a few examples of students helping each other.


Sun Feb  7 10:51:08 PST 2021

I added an open ended "challenge question" including a class competition for some minimal extra credit to keep the attention of the more advanced students in STAT196k.
My first impressions are that it's working great.

Another thing I received positive feedback on was letting students visually self assess where they are on the spectrum of computing proficiency.
This clearly showed the diverse range of backgrounds people bring to this class.


Sat Jan 30 11:04:37 PST 2021

AWS is also nice for making the class more equitable, because a student with a big new computer has no advantage.


Tue Jan 26 13:35:42 PST 2021

Watching Computing in the Statistics and Data Science webinar.
Nick Horton and Jo Hardin
Great talk.

Idea: read a paper a week.

Journal of Statistics and data science education.
I need to start getting into that.


Mon Jan 25 15:03:20 PST 2021

Here's why I use Discord to supplement class activities:

1. Students already use it.
2. It preserves an easily searchable record.
    Students can check to see if a question has been answered.
3. Students can form their own groups, and float between groups.
4. It has URL links to every post, useful for pointing out results.

I involve the students in an activity during the first week of classes to set community expectations around online etiquette.
This shows them where the boundaries are.


Fri Jan 22 10:38:29 PST 2021

I like the idea of having many small, regular assignments focused on self contained skills, and then larger "project" assignments that bring together many of these skills to do actual practical data analysis.
Students tend to work at the last minute, despite their best intentions.
There's a huge psychological difference between, "yeah, you should do these exercises on your own, for your own benefit" and "turn it in for credit".
The credit is much better motivation.
How often do I do the exercises if I'm casually reading some technical writing?
Almost never.

With Canvas, it's not any harder to have multiple assignments, particularly when things are graded automatically.
In contrast, if we turn everything in by hand, that's a lot of paper to handle.
This is an example of technology, Canvas, allowing me to do something better for the students.


Tue Jan 19 09:31:49 PST 2021

Think about a 5 minute interview for a class of 30.
That's 150 minutes = 2.5 hours, which is not at all bad if I break it up over say 4 sessions.
The purpose is so that students feel more comfortable talking to me, and more at ease in the class.
It gives them a chance to directly ask anything they might not feel comfortable asking in front of their peers.

What should I change for STAT 50 compared to last semester?

1. Give points for participation
2. Force numerical precision in calculations
3. More opportunities for interaction.
    Group work? No.
    How about more group discussions and assignment feedback?

I like the group discussion idea.
In STAT 128 I used groups of 5-6, and that was too few for breakout rooms.
I'm going to do more Canvas discussions- those worked well with around 10 students of faculty members in a few different settings.
I didn't encounter any issues with going too big- like for the video review assignments with the whole class of 60.
KISS for the feedback / responses- identify one thing that works well, and one way to improve.


Thu Dec 17 08:18:52 PST 2020

Next time for final project in STAT 128:

- Emphasize narrative in project
- Require introduction / abstract

Many students using Tidyverse for final project, even though I didn't teach it.
Perhaps it's worth teaching / relying more heavily on?

Idea: Linear regression to uncover the weights for final grades.


Tue Dec 15 08:22:35 PST 2020

For the final I required 0.1% numerical accuracy, compared to 1% on the midterm, and this is causing a problem.
I called it out explicitly in the instructions, and showed how to do them correctly, but good students are still messing it up.
So I either need to relax the numerical accuracy standards, or get them in the habit of doing the correct computations earlier on.


Thu Dec 10 10:42:05 PST 2020

Received some great feedback on the oral interview.
It needs to be 15 minutes, not 10 minutes.

- Doing a 5 minute interview early in the semester could be valuable for building rapport with the students, and making them feel comfortable turning on their cameras.
- I need to be more animated when giving lectures.
- Students need a points incentive to participate.
- Never call on students for an extended amount of time.
    If they don't respond in <5 seconds, then move on.
    One student fell asleep when I did this, and he was so embarrassed that he never came back to live class.



Thu Dec 10 10:20:40 PST 2020

I think it would be better to have the final project earlier, say 2/3 of the way through the semester.
Students seem more motivated then, judging by the assignment submission patterns.
Call it the "class project".

Several students have mentioned how they don't want to ask questions in other classes because of the attitude of their instructors if the ask a basic question, instructor says "How can you not know that?"
This is a real shame.

If I spend a bunch of time answering a question that's too basic or too advanced, then it doesn't help the majority of the class.
I'm learning that it's safer to assume students don't have the background, and then bring them up to speed.

I've been using basic questions as an opportunity to go beyond, and make connections that can benefit students at different levels.
For example, the question, "How do I make a bar plot using the ggplot2 software?" wouldn't be particularly interesting if I just provided a one line answer.
Instead of answering, I went explicitly through my programming and discovery process, which includes:

- Coming up with a minimal working example
- Stating clearly what I would like to produce
- Trying something I think might work
- Making a slight change so I can get to something that does work, but does the wrong thing
- Reading the documentation to discover how the relevant function, `geom_bar`, should be used.
- Applying the documentation and getting it to work as I intend.

Students need to practice and understand this reasoning / problem solving process far more than they need to see an expertly finished product of code.

This makes me think that I need to leave more time in class to let students ask me their questions, and demonstrate this process live.


Thu Dec  3 10:23:08 PST 2020

Next time for STAT 128- get students used to summarizing results.
Maybe use multiple projects?
Also post in response to summaries.

Idea: concisely summarize high level highlights of results.
Explain one plot.
Can do it through video or writing.


Wed Nov 25 11:04:58 PST 2020

Saw positive responses for Kahoot extra credit quiz, for example:

> While other gave us online zoom recordings and quizzes @professor fitz gave us extra credit :pray:
> Thank you professor

I think the quick feedback helped with this- I put the extra credit in immediately after the quiz.
It's one less TODO item for later.

This makes me think about the human psychology around the language "extra credit".
It's similar to buying something that is $500 on sale for $400 with "free shipping".
Compared to paying the standard fixed price of $350 with $20 shipping.

With extra credit, students feel good, like they're doing something above and beyond.


Thu Oct 22 09:26:15 PDT 2020

Did a lecture in STAT 50 where we discussed real life scenarios and which data generated processes should be IID.
It felt right- less formal mathematics, more reasoning about what the underlying concepts and assumptions are.


Tue Sep 22 12:01:31 PDT 2020

For online courses

TODO: incorporate video assignments into courses.

Thu Jul 23 13:58:28 PDT 2020

Reading [NYT article on effort and achievement](https://nymag.com/news/features/27840/).
I wonder how I can incorporate more safe failure into my classes?
"Write about what you don't understand, and what you've tried to learn it."


Tue Jul  7 07:45:02 PDT 2020

stat128: activity on "cleaning up code".
    Take code that repeats itself many times, and put it in an `lapply`.
    Write process for this: identify repetition, put it in function, call appropriate apply function.


Fri Jun 12 15:23:04 PDT 2020

Idea: Optional class meetings?
Need some way to filter the breakout rooms so that only people who actually want to talk are there.

Teaching philosophy: Students get out of school what they put into it.


Fri Jun 12 15:13:53 PDT 2020

Applying to summer online teaching


__Specifically, what is the single most important thing you hope to gain/learn from the STEM Side Car experience that will directly impact your teaching in the Fall?__

I hope to learn techniques to engage students and cultivate a sense of community in the online classroom. 
I believe that for online classes, this sense of community can only come from intentional structure and design of activities; it won't happen spontaneously as it sometimes does in a physical classroom.
Once classes went online in Spring 2020, I found it difficult to encourage students to speak up and ask questions.
Sometimes worksheet breakout sessions with small groups sparked vibrant conversation, and other times they were completely silent.
How can I design my online classes so students can benefit from our department's relatively small class sizes?
How can I help students invest in the online class community, and feel they belong?


__How are you hoping this experience will affect your future teaching?__

First of all, I need basic education in how to teach effectively.
Spring 2020 was my first semester teaching, and my PhD at an R1 University didn't emphasize teaching too much.

Second, I hope that I can incorporate some of the positive aspects of online classes into my future in person classes.
For example, some simple grading tasks can be automated, which provides students with immediate feedback compared to returning paper copies.



Fri May 15 06:38:29 PDT 2020

What I want in hand written assignment grading:

- detailed feedback
- anonymous, as in- I don't want to know who I'm grading, because otherwise whatever opinion I've formed on that student could creep in.
- PDF with camscanner, or other app
- rectangle around final answer


Thu May 14 17:03:05 PDT 2020

Grading finals now, fighting with Canvas rubrics because I'm trying to use them like I used Gradescope, and they're not working.
The lowest score on the final was from a student who turned all the HW in super early, before I even posted lectures.
How were they doing the hw?
It makes me think the HW score should be worth relatively less.

Next time I'm going to make everyone use cam scanner, or something that compiles a PDF.
So much easier for grading.


Fri May  1 08:24:10 PDT 2020

There are so many little things to consider when teaching online.
For example, I use a small 13" monitor so that when I share my screen students who also may be on small monitors can see what I'm doing.


Wed Apr 29 09:58:37 PDT 2020

It seems like males participate more in the online group discussion activities.
Is this a real effect?
No, I think it's just one class has few females, most of whom are quiet.


Wed Apr 15 15:45:29 PDT 2020

I like using names in my word problems.
It makes things feel more engaging, more active.
Further, I can sample names from a diverse mix of students to quietly slip in the idea that all races and genders can do stats / math / computing.

Compare:
"A 95% confidence interval was found."

"Chloe found a 95% confidence interval."



Sat Apr  4 09:58:16 PDT 2020

Students are complaining (fairly) that it's not clear what they need to study to do well on the exams.
I'm thinking that for a lower division course I need to be very explicit about what's required to pass.
I think the 25-30% fail rate is not good.
Probably this should mean they can do basic problems like the ones on the homework.
To get an A is another matter- for this they should be able to do harder problems.


Fri Mar 27 10:34:37 PDT 2020

Aligning course outcomes is a powerful feature in Canvas.
I'm using these.
Students ask for study guides- standards and evaluation should be clear and focused, especially in lower division classes where students follow a relativey structured material.

It might be educational to plant incorrect solutions to quizzes in Canvas.
Then students should carefully review their solutions to quizzes to make sure they understand them.


Mon Mar  9 07:57:35 PDT 2020

Most students in Stat 50 don't start HW until day it's due.
I know because of online HW.
For lower div courses I prefer to give more short assignments, i.e. 2 or 3 per week rather than 1 per week.
It's also not worth much of their grade, only 10%.


Fri Mar  6 06:51:06 PST 2020

I've been having quizzes and exams on Friday- I wonder how much the day of the week matters?
I do like to get them back graded the next class meeting, and that's easier if I have more than 1 day.

Wondering how much to focus on calculation versus conceptual questions.
I think it's good to have a mix of both.


Mon Feb 24 13:38:53 PST 2020

Avoid dependent problems, because it's hard if students make a mistake early on, and you need to track it through the problem.


Sat Feb 22 06:58:13 PST 2020

In the word problems I'm starting to use names that are representative of the student body population, rather than "Joe".


Wed Feb 19 15:02:24 PST 2020

Just watched a webinar on mid course evaluations.
Seems like a good idea, especially early in the course.
It asks whether the teacher mostly lectures, or uses in class activities.

It mentioned observable outcomes, such as:

- Is the course well organized?
- Are the assignments clear?
- Has the instructor made an effort to learn my name?
- Do I get timely feedback?

Then it left free form text.
Let it be anonymous.

I plan to administer it in the hope that I can use the info to improve the course this semester.

I should do more coding and simulation in class.
I'll bet they would like that.
