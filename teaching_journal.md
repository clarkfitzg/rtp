I like using names in my word problems.
It makes things feel more engaging, more active.
Further, I can sample names from a diverse mix of students to quietly slip in the idea that all races and genders can do stats / math / computing.

Compare:
"A 95% confidence interval was found."

"Chloe found a 95% confidence interval."

Students are complaining (fairly) that it's not clear what they need to study to do well on the exams.
I'm thinking that for a lower division course I need to be very explicit about what's required to pass.
I think the 25-30% fail rate is not good.
Probably this should mean they can do basic problems like the ones on the homework.
To get an A is another matter- for this they should be able to do harder problems.

Aligning course outcomes is a powerful feature in Canvas.
I'm using these.
Students ask for study guides- standards and evaluation should be clear and focused, especially in lower division classes where students follow a relativey structured material.

It might be educational to plant incorrect solutions to quizzes in Canvas.
Then students should carefully review their solutions to quizzes to make sure they understand them.

Most students in Stat 50 don't start HW until day it's due.
I know because of online HW.
For lower div courses I prefer to give more short assignments, i.e. 2 or 3 per week rather than 1 per week.
It's also not worth much of their grade, only 10%.

I've been having quizzes and exams on Friday- I wonder how much the day of the week matters?
I do like to get them back graded the next class meeting, and that's easier if I have more than 1 day.

Wondering how much to focus on calculation versus conceptual questions.
I think it's good to have a mix of both.

Avoid dependent problems, because it's hard if students make a mistake early on, and you need to track it through the problem.

In the word problems I'm starting to use names that are representative of the student body population, rather than "Joe".

Just watched a webinar on mid course evaluations.
Seems like a good idea, especially early in the course.
It asks whether the teacher mostly lectures, or uses in class activities.

It mentioned observable outcomes, such as:

- Is the course well organized?
- Are the assignments clear?
- Has the instructor made an effort to learn my name?
- Do I get timely feedback?

Then it left free form text.
Let it be anonymous.

I plan to administer it in the hope that I can use the info to improve the course this semester.

I should do more coding and simulation in class.
I'll bet they would like that.
