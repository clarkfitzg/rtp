Final Action Plan Deliverable Template


Module Notes

## 1

Wow, it's great to have the firsthand student experience in a Canvas course!
My first impression is that there's a ton of stuff to do- information everywhere, some of it conflicting.
Walls and walls of text- yuck.
For example, do I need to respond to 1 slide or 2 slides on the intro activity?
The instructions on the slides say 1, but the rubric says 2.
The instructors ask us to 'add them to the Canvas courses', but don't provide any instructions on how to do that.
I already know how, so I look for the instructor email, but it's not on their profile.
I can't respond to the announcement, so I can't ask for clarification there.
I found the answer in my Canvas inbox, buried way down in a mass email.

Lesson: Pick one way to communicate with students, and use that consistently.
Canvas announcements are probably best, because they show up right on top of the course page.
Also, allow student replies on the announcement to ask for clarification right there.

There are a bunch of assignments on my Canvas TODO.
If I were a student with 5 classes, I would probably be doing the ones that are due soonest.
One assignment per week in my courses might be bad, because then students will probably put it off.
I think it's much easier to learn math and programming if you do shorter assignments regularly, instead of long assignments infrequently.

DRY- Do not Repeat Yourself.
Why are there different instructions for the same assignment in multiple places?
Better to just put everything on a rubric, and grade strictly from the rubric. 
Then there are no surprises.

Regarding course structure and navigation, I think simpler is usually better, especially in our current situation.
The QM template has 12 pages in the Welcome module.
If a student takes 5 courses, and each instructor uses this template, then the student needs to navigate through 60 pages, most of which is boilerplate.
This seems excessive and possibly counterproductive if the purpose of the pages is to highlight elements specific to this course.

I'm tempted to just delete everything from the template.
It's difficult for me to find a particular piece of information when I don't know what page it's on, because I have to click through every page.
In contrast, if you put all the administrative information on one page, the syllabus, then students and I can use CTRL+F on our web browsers to find the particular word we're interested in.

Of course, I want the students to feel welcome and included, and to have a clear idea of what's happening.
Maybe there are better ways to do this than creating a bunch of HTML pages.
For example, embed the welcome video in an announcement.
