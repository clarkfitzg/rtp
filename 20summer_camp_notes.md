Final Action Plan Deliverable Template


Module Notes

## 1

Wow, it's great to have the firsthand student experience in a Canvas course!
My first impression is that there's a ton of stuff to do- information everywhere, some of it conflicting.
Walls and walls of text- yuck.
For example, do I need to respond to 1 slide or 2 slides on the intro activity?
The instructions on the slides say 1, but the rubric says 2.
The instructors ask us to 'add them to the Canvas courses', but don't provide any instructions on how to do that.
I already know how, so I look for the instructor email, but it's not on their profile.
I can't respond to the announcement, so I can't ask for clarification there.
I found the answer in my Canvas inbox, buried way down in a mass email.

Lesson: Pick one way to communicate with students, and use that consistently.
Canvas announcements are probably best, because they show up right on top of the course page.
Also, allow student replies on the announcement to ask for clarification right there.

There are a bunch of assignments on my Canvas TODO.
If I were a student with 5 classes, I would probably be doing the ones that are due soonest.
One assignment per week in my courses might be bad, because then students will probably put it off.
I think it's much easier to learn math and programming if you do shorter assignments regularly, instead of long assignments infrequently.

DRY- Do not Repeat Yourself.
Why are there different instructions for the same assignment in multiple places?
Better to just put everything on a rubric, and grade strictly from the rubric. 
Then there are no surprises.

Regarding course structure and navigation, I think simpler is usually better, especially in our current situation.
The QM template has 12 pages in the Welcome module.
If a student takes 5 courses, and each instructor uses this template, then the student needs to navigate through 60 pages, most of which is boilerplate.
This seems excessive and possibly counterproductive if the purpose of the pages is to highlight elements specific to this course.

I'm tempted to just delete everything from the template.
It's difficult for me to find a particular piece of information when I don't know what page it's on, because I have to click through every page.
In contrast, if you put all the administrative information on one page, the syllabus, then students and I can use CTRL+F on our web browsers to find the particular word we're interested in.

Of course, I want the students to feel welcome and included, and to have a clear idea of what's happening.
Maybe there are better ways to do this than creating a bunch of HTML pages.
For example, embed the welcome video in an announcement.

How can students know if they're all caught up in my class?
I want that to be completely clear.

Got an email reminding me to turn in an assignment that I already turned in.
This makes me wonder: "did I actually turn in the assignment?"
This could cause students stress.
We can eliminate this by using the feature on Canvas: "message students who have not completed this assignment", and not mentioning deadlines in other places.
In other words- communicate consistently, and try to be DRY.

What do I _have_ to know, as in what will I be tested on?
What's just a supplemental resource?
What should I read before doing the homework?

In the first week's quiz I could ask students what concerns they have, and how we can work together to mitigate them.
This might not be so hot, because it's negative.

The references in this course are clumsy.
I have no idea what QM 2.4, 3.9 means.
Better to use the power of the web and hyperlink where appropriate.

Some students like community and working together, while others like to just do their own work and be done.
I should offer ways for both to be successful, and keep the invitations open.
Also I should be clear on which activities are mandatory and which are not.
I want a community, but it's hard to force it on people.

Some students might struggle to get to class consistently, for many reasons.
What should I do about that?

Course suggests avoiding long lectures- good thing I already do that with my YouTube lectures.

Excellent question in one of the videos- what do you want your students to remember / take away from your course in one year, five years?
Keep this in mind when you write your course outcomes.

Idea: Assign students to write blog posts describing techniques with computation in STAT 128.
Clearly identify the audience: i.e. someone with an undergrad CS degree, but no knowledge of R.
This helps prepare them to be content creators.
Another assignment- interpret a data analysis for a general technical audience, explaining the techniques used.

I like Fink's taxonomy.
What's really important with computing is learning how to learn, how to test your mental model of what is happening.
The nuts and bolts of a particular language's syntax can be dull and similar.
It's better to understand the design and unifying ideas behind it all, or how certain decisions were made, and what the tradeoffs were.

I missed the deadlines to do peer review because I didn't work on a Sunday, and didn't bother to look at what was due that weekend.

I think the biggest problem for me last quarter was a lack of alignment.
This came out in the feedback, when students rightly complained that the exams were more difficult- on par with the worksheets, and the lectures and homeworks didn't prepare them to succeed on them.

Watching these videos and navigating the content in the online school, I feel pretty beat after a couple hours.
Could be the time of day, plus 6+ hours of screen time already today.
I'll bet students feel like that all the time, especially for courses that they're not excited about.

Feedback in assessments is nice.
I should do more of that.
