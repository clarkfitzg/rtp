Great articles from the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, following a webinar.
It's got me excited about doing some research in the field.
I appreciate that the journal is open access.

I got my website up and going, and put a little content on there, enough to start.
Now I need a goal.
What's going to be a good sell for the RTP?
I need to demonstrate impact.
Getting a bunch of traffic is fine, but I don't think it's especially compelling.
Growth in traffic might be interesting.

Personal narratives and accounts of how people use this content could be quite useful.
My Sac state email is already publicly out there, so I can add a footer to every page along the lines of, "If you find this useful or you spot an error, please let me know." with my email address.

Another thing to remember is that I don't need to write the content for every single lecture for STAT 50.
I can just link and cover existing content in the Canvas page.
The biggest value add from my website happens when the content doesn't exist.

What uses of my site are the most valuable?
David mentioned that if I can show others are using them in courses, that's a good thing.
Well, any email shows some kind of broader impacts.

Where do I want people to share it?
Here are a few options:
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- Hacker News
- Reddit


## Online Presence

I've started writing educational material, and I think I'll probably write quite a bit more in the future.
Should I attempt to publicize it outside of my classes?
This means sharing it on public forums like Twitter and Discord.
I'm concerned that these apps eat up too much of my time.
I'm also concerned that writing educational materials won't count for much when it comes to tenure.
I want to do it in the first place because the resources don't exist, and I need to make them available in some form for my classes.
It's also for my own benefit- writing about something forces me to understand it better.

How can I mitigate my concerns?
I can accept that the materials aren't perfect- avoid excessive editing and wordsmithing.
Just get something out there.
I can also allocate a specific amount of time to spend on public forums and email, and strictly stick to that.
Treat it all as more of a broadcasting service.
Have some "Sorry if I don't respond- I spend limited time online." 
I can ignore whoever I want to ignore- people will disagree and criticize.
No reason to humor the trolls.
I can keep the apps off my phone, so I'm not tempted to constantly check in.

What are the peripheral benefits to getting my name out there?
Jake Vanderplas said that his blog helped him get his job at UW.
Man, his resume is impressive- I need to quit reading those :)
I'm not looking for a job, but having some name recognition could help with speaking at conferences, and general good will in the open source community.

Just learned that I have a web page through Sac State.
I can publish my blog and course content there.
I'd rather have full control over the HTML generation than go through Canvas for the STAT 128 stuff.

Going to speak with David Z. about research projects.
The more clear I am about what I want to do, the more productive of a conversation we can have.
Here is what I'm considering:


## Pedagogy

I could work on material and design for course notes for STAT 128 and 129.
I would like to develop a textbook and/or website that uses proven methods to teach data science and statistical computing.
This means I need to review and understand the literature of pedagogy, which would be a good thing to improve my teaching.
The other appeal is that by preparing and thinking hard about this over the summer, I can have better classes and a lower workload during the next academic year.


## Software

Software is nice because there are many entry points for students at different levels, so if I want to get an undergraduate student to come work with me, they can actually do something.
The following are some software project ideas.


#### Data science in Julia.

I could start evaluating and possibly contributing to the Julia data science stack.
One place that looks interesting is OnlineStats.
I've been interested in this sort of thing since at least 2015.

In my PhD I've also developed some ideas that related to MapReduce, which might apply well here.


#### Develop existing PhD software.

Right now I don't really have anything usable from my PhD.
If my software worked, and was robust, I'm sure some people would find it useful.
I'm just not sure I care enough to promote it and get it to that state, and then deal with all the inevitable technical issues that will come up.
I'm also tired of working around R's idiosyncracies.


#### Metadata standards.

The rough idea is to use metadata to make the computation more efficient, in a language agnostic way.
This is baked into some data formats, like Parquet and HDF5.
Maybe it's not that interesting then, because we should just be using those formats.

A more interesting question is how to represent the semantics of all the data?
For example, what do the rows mean?
What do the levels of a factor mean?
Where can you find more information?
Some of these ideas exist in the semantic web, and a few databases, but a better implementation would be nice.

Probably could have been more productive at the D3 event last night.
It's hard when I don't feel well, and I had something immediate hanging over my head that I had to do that night.
I should have went into it thinking about who I wanted to talk to, and what I wanted to accomplish.
