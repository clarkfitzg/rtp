Going to speak with David Z. about research projects.
The more clear I am about what I want to do, the more productive of a conversation we can have.
Here is what I'm considering:


## Pedagogy

I could work on material and design for course notes for STAT 128 and 129.
I would like to develop a textbook and/or website that uses proven methods to teach data science and statistical computing.
This means I need to review and understand the literature of pedagogy, which would be a good thing to improve my teaching.
The other appeal is that by preparing and thinking hard about this over the summer, I can have better classes and a lower workload during the next academic year.


## Software

Software is nice because there are many entry points for students at different levels, so if I want to get an undergraduate student to come work with me, they can actually do something.
The following are some software project ideas.


#### Data science in Julia.

I could start evaluating and possibly contributing to the Julia data science stack.
One place that looks interesting is OnlineStats.
I've been interested in this sort of thing since at least 2015.

In my PhD I've also developed some ideas that related to MapReduce, which might apply well here.


#### Develop existing PhD software.

Right now I don't really have anything usable from my PhD.
If my software worked, and was robust, I'm sure some people would find it useful.
I'm just not sure I care enough to promote it and get it to that state, and then deal with all the inevitable technical issues that will come up.
I'm also tired of working around R's idiosyncracies.


#### Metadata standards.

The rough idea is to use metadata to make the computation more efficient, in a language agnostic way.
This is baked into some data formats, like Parquet and HDF5.
Maybe it's not that interesting then, because we should just be using those formats.

A more interesting question is how to represent the semantics of all the data?
For example, what do the rows mean?
What do the levels of a factor mean?
Where can you find more information?
Some of these ideas exist in the semantic web, and a few databases, but a better implementation would be nice.

Probably could have been more productive at the D3 event last night.
It's hard when I don't feel well, and I had something immediate hanging over my head that I had to do that night.
I should have went into it thinking about who I wanted to talk to, and what I wanted to accomplish.
