General answers to how are you?

- people not crazy 

"I think I'd like to see more credit towards class participation/warm call and showing up for zoom."

Yes... students like the participation and engagement, so we need to incentivize it.

Suggestions:

- Post solutions to HW's not from book.
    We can do these in OH.
- More practice problems.
    I assign practice questions, about the bare minimum you need in my mind.
    You are of course welcome to do more in the book, and you can ask me about them in office hours.

TODO this semester:

- Announce homework / assignments in class
- More problem examples similar to HW / exams
    How about on Tuesday office hours?
- More 123 GO
I like the low tech and lack of preparation with the 123 Go activities.


TODO next semester:

- short post class quizzes, Kahoot?
- Different due dates for bigger HW?
