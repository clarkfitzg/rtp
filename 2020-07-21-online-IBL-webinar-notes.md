IBL: Inquiry based learning

MAA webinar

notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ear4K3YZe03nPnufm1PFiTCIyoAsRvMiKxrAM-7Td4g/edit

Their intro slide says something like "be engaged, be changed"

Give students time in class to solve problems.

IDEA: Allow students to give feedback to each other's work sometimes.

Different modes of participation (chat, voice, discussion boards) allow more opportunities for students to interact, thus becoming an asset for inclusivity.

Clips:

1. Instructor compliments competence of class.
    What's the value of having one student read a solution?
2. Talking through visual ideas with hands.
    Great idea- draw a graph, good for students to interact.
    Immediate Q&A response from teacher is nice.
    Might be nice to have a timer to know how long students have to work.
    Instructor exudes charisma, yet the class experience is still awkward.
3. Content coming through more clearly than the other videos.
    Soliciting feedback through chat seems pretty effective.
    Wondering... if students type slowly, it might be difficult to participate in this way.

Facilitator checking in can be disruptive in breakout rooms.

From a course description:

> Students who complete all of the mastery-based quizzes and WebAssign problems earn a B+ in the course.
> Students who complete fewer than the maximum number of items will earn a lower grading on a sliding scale.
> Students who want to earn an A in the course, must successfully complete a final project.

I like this idea- let students know very explicitly where the bars are set to earn specific grades.
Students have limited time.
Kind of like offering the course at a graduate and undergraduate level.
This could even disincentivize certain kinds of cheating.
