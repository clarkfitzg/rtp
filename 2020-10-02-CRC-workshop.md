Thomas Krabacher, Amy Wagner on Senate Committee Committee, University wide.

CRC - curriculum review committee at NSM

196 experimental courses not due until October 19.
Only need review at the college level.

Will probably want to submit our permanent course proposal next fall.

We may need a more substantial justification.
We have just one sentence now.
Explain how it fits into our current curriculum, what holes it fills.

People look hard at the learning outcomes.
Check out pop up for learning outcomes in question mark.
Use active words for learning goals, not "understand"

Need to attach syllabus with learning outcomes, not at the end.

Assessment strategies must be explicitly tied to learning outcomes.
It's OK to have general assessment strategies, like us, if we have good learning outcomes.

Don't want to make big changes that will impact another department.
For us, this means don't require CS class if we can help it.

March 5 deadline for changes to fall courses.
Deadline calendar: https://www.csus.edu/academic-affairs/curriculum-workflow/curriculum-deadlines.html
Need to work backwards to see actual date.

Justification:

Statisticians and data scientists need specific training to work with large, complex data sets.
The proposed "Big Data" course can be considered as a follow up to "Statistical Computing" (STAT 128), which we currently offer.
Compared to STAT 128, the proposed course will cover some topics at a deeper level, as well as different, more advanced topics, such as remote computing.
Students who take both courses will be well prepared for practical data analysis, whether in a graduate program, or in an entry level data scientist position.
