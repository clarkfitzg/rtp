Side note- Much of the stuff in expectations appears to be common across one of campus / college / department.
Why does it need to be in the syllabus?

For example:

> Describe where and how students obtain necessary computers, web cameras, wifi hot spots, and/or parking lots locations on campus where free wifi connections can be accessed

None of this is at all specific to my course, so I'd rather point the students to a central resource.

Why does the teaching strategy need to be on the syllabus?
I suppose that it shows the instructor is thinking about it.


Comments on peer's syllabus:

Can't find anything regarding online teaching.

Logistics

- location
- instructor info
- tech requirement

Course Structure

- Outcomes are kind of in the course objectives
- Add drop policy
