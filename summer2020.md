## Summer 2020 Proposal

_Submitted to Dr. David Zeigler, Chair, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, on June 15, 2020._

This summer I plan to foster a community of local users of the new [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
Julia builds on existing compiler technology to solve many of the challenges in statistical computing through its fundamental design, which makes it a compelling choice for researchers experimenting with data science software and numerical algorithms.
Second, I plan to work with a student on a computer vision machine learning project that he proposed.
Finally, I plan to develop my personal expertise in the Julia language to the point where I can use it to develop open source, general purpose statistical software over the coming years.
These summer objectives are steps towards establishing Sac State's presence on the frontier of data science technology.


## Weekly Meetings

I've gathered a reading group of faculty members and students to learn the Julia language this summer.
Our group will meet weekly for six weeks to share and discuss solutions to the mathematical / algorithmic problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), starting June 19th.
These problems feature a wide range of difficulty, which makes them inclusive and interesting to programmers at all levels, from college freshmen to research mathematicians.
The Project Euler website verifies the correctness of the solution, which will allow us to build skill and confidence as Julia programmers.

Our reading group will strengthen the data science technology user community at Sac State.
As our students graduate and take local jobs, they can continue to use Julia and other languages in their work, promoting the growth of these productive technologies, and increasing the demand for courses to teach them.
By strengthening the local programming community in Sacramento we can support the growth of appealing local tech jobs, which aligns with the [Anchor University Initiative](https://www.csus.edu/experience/anchor-university/).


## Student Proposed Machine Learning Project

An undergraduate student proposed the following project: train a machine learning model to distinguish videos of different skateboarding tricks.
We will start by producing labeled data of two skateboarding tricks: ollie and kickflip.
Some of the data will include tricks performed by the student and by me.
This labeled data is a valuable research output, and we plan to publish it through a publicly available outlet such as [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash).

We will use the data to train a neural network, and test the classification performance of the model on new test data.
The student will write an article describing our approach: what we tried, what worked, what didn't work, and why.
I will edit and revise the article, and we will publish it online using [Github](https://github.com/clarkfitzg).
We hope to achieve test set classification accuracy of at least 90%, but realistically, many factors could prevent this.
If our results are good or otherwise illuminating, we will apply to present the work at a meetup such as the [Bay Area Julia Users](https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Julia-Users/).


## Other Expected Outcomes

Personally, I plan to deepen my involvement with the Julia language in a couple other ways.
I will continue my career as an open source developer by contributing to the [improved documentation of the Julia language](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/36202) and related packages.
Second, I will write an article describing what programmers in R and Python should know about Julia, and describing my transition.
I will publish this article on the [discourse site](https://discourse.julialang.org/)
