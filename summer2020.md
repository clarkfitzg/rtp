## Summer 2020 Proposal

_Submitted to Dr. David Zeigler, Chair, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, on June 13, 2020._

This summer I plan to foster a community of local users of the relatively new [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).

Julia builds on existing technology to solve many of the challenges in statistical computing through its fundamental design.
I believe that Julia is a superlative choice for researchers experimenting with novel numerical methods and algorithms.
Over the coming years, I plan to develop open source, general purpose statistical software using Julia.

This aligns with the CSUS [Anchor University Initiative](https://www.csus.edu/experience/anchor-university/) by involving people in the Sacramento Area with cutting edge, productive, high technology.


## Weekly meetings

I've gathered a group of interested faculty members and students to meet weekly from June 19 through July 24.
We'll use the mathematical problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) to learn the language and build confidence by solving concrete, manageable problems.

Student proposal ML project


## Expected Outcomes

- Contribute to the documentation of the Julia language
- Write an article describing my experience learning Julia, with a background in R/Python
- An ML model for classifying skateboard tricks
- A community of users with a baseline knowledge and experience with the Julia language
